Neurosurgical services in the Northern Zone of Sarawak in Malaysia: The way forward amid COVID-19 pandemic. (16)
BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has set a huge challenge to the delivery of neurosurgical services including the transfer of patients. (24) 
We aimed to share our strategy in handling neurosurgical emergencies at a remote center in Borneo Island. (17)
Our objectives included discussing the logistic and geographical challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. (14)

METHODS: Miri General Hospital (MGH) is a remote center in Sarawak, Malaysia, serving a population with difficult access to neurosurgical services. (21)
Two neurosurgeons were stationed here on a rotational basis every fortnight during the pandemic to handle neurosurgical cases. (18)
Patients were triaged depending on their urgent needs for surgery or transfer to a neurosurgical center and managed accordingly. (19)
All patients were screened for potential risk of contracting COVID-19 prior to the surgery.  (14)
Based on this, the level of personal protective equipment required for the healthcare workers involved was determined. (17)

RESULTS: During the initial six weeks of the Movement Control Order (MCO) in Malaysia, there were 50 urgent neurosurgical consultations. (20)
Twenty patients (40%) required emergency surgery or intervention. (8)
There were nine vascular (45%), five trauma (25%), four tumor (15%), and two infection cases (10%).  (16)
Eighteen patients were operated at MGH, among whom 17 (94.4%) survived. (11)
Ninety percent of anticipated transfers were avoided. (7)
None of the medical staff acquired COVID-19. (7)

CONCLUSIONS: This framework allowed timely intervention for neurosurgical emergencies (within a safe limit), 
minimized transfer, and enabled uninterrupted neurosurgical services at a remote center with difficult access to neurosurgical care during a pandemic. (33)

COVID-19 Infection Among Healthcare Workers in a National Healthcare System: the Qatar Experience. (13)
BACKGROUND: Our aim was to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers (HCW) in a national healthcare system and to understand the risk factors for infection. (28)

METHODS: The study was conducted at Hamad Medical Corporation in Qatar, a national healthcare system with 14 hospitals and >28,000 employees, between March 10-June 24, 2020. (27x) (26)
Data on COVID-19+ HCW were retrieved from the electronic health records and employment records, followed by an email survey and a focused telephone interview. (24)

RESULTS: Among 16,912 HCW tested, 10.6% tested positive. (9x) (8)
Hospitalization rate was 11.6%, 1.3% required supplemental oxygen, 0.6% needed intensive care unit admission and 0.3% required mechanical ventilation. (19)
There were no deaths.  (4)
In a follow-up survey of 393 HCW, 5% reported acquiring infection at a COVID-19-designated facility and 95% at a non-COVID-19 facility having acquired the infection through accidental exposure to a colleague (45%) or a patient (29%). (36)       
Full PPE adherence was 82% at COVID-19-designated but only 68% at non-COVID-19 facilities. (13)

CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection among HCW often occurs among those not directly working with COVID-19 patients. (15)
PPE use is less stringent in such settings. (8)
Risk of exposure and need for strict PPE must be stressed upon all HCW in all settings.(17)
