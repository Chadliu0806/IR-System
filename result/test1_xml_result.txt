Dental care management during the COVID-19 outbreak.
AIM: The level of preparedness of the healthcare system plays an important role in management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 
This study attempted to devise a comprehensive protocol regarding dental care during the COVID-19 outbreak.

METHODS AND RESULT: Embase, PubMed, and Google Scholar were searched until March 2020 for relevant papers. (16)
Sixteen English papers were enrolled to answer questions about procedures that are allowed to perform during the COVID-19 outbreak, (19)
patients who are in priority to receive dental care services, the conditions and necessities for patient admission, (17)
waiting room and operatory room, and personal protective equipment (PPE) that is necessary for dental clinicians and the office staff. (20)

CONCLUSION: Dental treatment should be limited to patients with urgent or emergency situation. (13)
By screening questionnaires for COVID-19, patients are divided into three groups of (a) apparently healthy, (b) suspected for COVID-19, and (c) confirmed for COVID-19. (24)
Separate waiting and operating rooms should be assigned to each group of patients to minimize the risk of disease transmission. (20)
All groups should be treated with the same protective measures with regard to PPE for the dental clinicians and staff. (20)

Impact of interleukin-6 blockade with tocilizumab on SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics and antibody responses in patients with COVID-19: A prospective cohort study. (21)

BACKGROUND: The virological and immunological effects of the immunomodulatory drugs used for COVID-19 remain unknown. (15)
We evaluated the impact of interleukin (IL)-6 blockade with tocilizumab on SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics and the antibody response in patients with COVID-19. (22)    exp : (IL)-6

METHODS: Prospective cohort study in patients admitted with COVID-19. (9)
Serial nasopharyngeal and plasma samples were measured for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and S-IgG/N-IgG titers, respectively. (14)

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
FINDINGS: 138 patients with confirmed infection were included; 76 (55%) underwent IL-6 blockade. (13)
Median initial SOFA (p?=?0??16) and SARS-CoV-2 viral load (p<0??01, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test) were significantly higher among anti-IL-6 users. (17)

Patients under IL-6 blockade showed delayed viral clearance in the Kaplan-Meier curves (HR 0??5 [95%CI] [0??5-0??1], log-rank p?=?0??14), (18)
but an adjusted propensity score matching model did not demonstrate a significant relationship of IL-6 blockade with viral clearance (HR 1??3 [0??5-7??]). (22)

Cox regression showed an inverse association between SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance and the initial viral load (HR 0??5 [0??1-0??9]). (18)
Patients under the IL-6 blocker showed shorter median time to seropositivity, higher peak antibody titers, (15)
and higher cumulative proportion of seropositivity in the Kaplan Meier curves (HR 3?? [1??-5] for S-IgG; and HR 3?? [1??-4??] for N-IgG; log-rank p<0??01 for both). (26)
However, no significant differences between groups were found in either S-IgG (HR 1??6 [0??1-6??]) nor N-IgG (HR 0??6 [0??6-3??]) responses in an adjusted propensity score analysis. (26)

IINTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, IL-6 blockade does not impair the viral specific antibody responses. (20)
Although a delayed viral clearance was observed, it was driven by a higher initial viral load. (16)
The study supports the safety of this therapy in patients with COVID-19.(12)

[Intrauterine growth retardation. (3)
Changes in obstetrical practice in France]. (6)

The change in practice in connection with fetal growth retardation was studied using two national enquiries on pregnancy and delivery carried out in 1976 and 1981. (26)
These showed important changes in practice between the two studies.(10)
Although ultrasound and fetal heart rate monitoring are widely used and are shown as being very important for pregnancies overall, they are not used more often in cases of fetal growth retardation. (32)
On the other hand, when they have been started these examinations are more often easily repeated.(16)
Recourse to hormonal essay has not changed in intra-uterine growth retardation cases (17%). (13)
The percentage of caesareans carried out for retardation rose from 9.4 to 17.4% and these caesarean operations were carried out earlier. (21)
50% of this increase is due to the decision to carry out a caesarean before labour starts.(17)
This more aggressive tendency means that the number of premature babies in growth retarded infants was higher in 1981, although the difference not significant and this practice would need further study.(31)
There are improvements in neonatal health as a result of the changes although one cannot pinpoint for certain which procedure has caused this improvement.(24)
